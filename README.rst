=================================
QuestDB Client Library for Python
=================================

This library makes it easy to insert data into `QuestDB <https://questdb.io>`_.

This client library implements QuestDB's variant of the
`InfluxDB Line Protocol <https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview/>`_
(ILP) over TCP.


Status of the library
=====================

Work in progress: do not use yet.

There will be an announcement on our `slack <http://slack.questdb.io>`_ once
it's ready for use.


Installation
=============

::

    python3 -m pip install questdb
