Changelog
=========

1.0.2 (2022-10-31)
------------------

* Support for Python 3.11.
* Updated to version 2.1.1 of the ``c-questdb-client`` library:

  * Setting ``SO_REUSEADDR`` on outbound socket. This is helpful to users with large number of connections who previously ran out of outbound network ports.


1.0.1 (2022-08-16)
------------------

* Fixed a major bug where Python ``int`` and ``float`` types were handled with
  32-bit instead of 64-bit precision. This caused certain ``int`` values to be
  rejected and other ``float`` values to be rounded incorrectly.
  Closes `#13 <https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client/issues/13>`_.
* As a matter of convenience, the ``Buffer.row`` method can now take ``None`` column
  values. This has the same semantics as skipping the column altogether.
  Closes `#3 <https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client/issues/3>`_.
* Fixed a minor bug where an error auto-flush caused a second clean-up error.
  Closes `#4 <https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client/issues/4>`_.


1.0.0 (2022-07-15)
